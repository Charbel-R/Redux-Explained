### Prop drilling 
- Prop drilling is a technique used to pass data as props from parent
component to child components.
- As the component tree grows deeper, data needs to be passed through many components.


### Redux/toolkit 
- It provides tools for managing application state in a centralized store.
- Components can connect to the store to access and update state data.
- This eliminates the need for prop drilling and improves code maintainability.
